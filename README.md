This agent was trained for 50 hours resulting in model too large to be uploaded here to github
This experiment showed that a Deep Q Learning model using CNN to look at pixels is not very efficient at learning.
Even after 50 hours, it could still barely score over 2000 throughout all of the training and when actually testing,
usually would perform similarly to the 5 hour trained model.
